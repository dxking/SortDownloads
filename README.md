# SortDownloads
PowerShell script that will sort files based off of extension from your Downloads folder to various folders defined in the config

# PowerShell

## How to use this script
Edit sd-config

Move sDownloads.ps1 and sd-config anywhere you'd like (as long as they're in the same directory)

Either manually run sDownloads.ps1 or use it with Task Scheduler

## How to edit sd-config
Open sd-config in any text editor

Enter the extension you want to move in the first column and put the destination you'd like it in the second column

Make sure your extensions have a period in front of them! (.exe, .jpg, etc)

I left extensions and paths in sd-config.csv to use as a template

# C#
I'm implementing a C# solution as a means to learn the language. Things will probably be done in strange manners.

# To Do:
- Allow generating sd-config with flag
- Add linux support
